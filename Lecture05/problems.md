## Problems Discussed in class

  - Pascal Triangle -> pascal.cpp
  - Rotate given no. of bits of a number -> rotateBits.cpp
  - Arrays Basics -> arrays.cpp
  - Search an element in given array -> linearSearch.cpp
  - Count the number of elements which are greater than all the elements on right side of an array -> greaterThanRight.cpp
  - Find and count all the elements before which all the elements are greater than it, and after which all are smaller -> leftGrightS.cpp

### Home work problems
 - Write a program that rotates arr[] of size n by d elements.
 - Given an array arr[] of N integers, the task is to swap the first and the last element then the third and the third last element then fifth and fifth last and so on. Print the final array after all the valid operations.
